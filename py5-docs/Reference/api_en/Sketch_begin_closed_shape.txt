@@ description
This method is used to start a custom closed shape. This method should only be used as a context manager, as shown in the examples. When used as a context manager, this will ensure that [](sketch_end_shape) always gets called, just like when using [](sketch_begin_shape) as a context manager. The difference is that when exiting, the parameter `CLOSE` will be passed to [](sketch_end_shape), connecting the last vertex to the first. This will close the shape. If this method were to be used not as a context manager, it won't be able to close the shape by making the call to [](sketch_end_shape).
