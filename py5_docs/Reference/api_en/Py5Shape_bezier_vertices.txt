coordinates: npt.NDArray[np.floating] - 2D array of bezier vertex coordinates with 6 or 9 columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively

@@ description
Create a collection of bezier vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_bezier_vertex) in a loop. For a large number of bezier vertices, the performance of `bezier_vertices()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each bezier vertex. The first few columns are for the first control point, the next few columns are for the second control point, and the final few columns are for the anchor point. There should be six or nine columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively.

Drawing 2D bezier curves requires using the `P2D` renderer and drawing 3D bezier curves requires using the `P3D` renderer. When drawing directly with `Py5Shape` objects, bezier curves do not work at all using the default renderer.

This method can only be used within a [](py5shape_begin_shape) and [](py5shape_end_shape) pair.
