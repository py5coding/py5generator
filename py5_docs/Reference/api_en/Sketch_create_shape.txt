@@ description
The ``create_shape()`` function is used to define a new shape. Once created, this shape can be drawn with the ``shape()`` function. The basic way to use the function defines new primitive shapes. One of the following parameters are used as the first parameter: ``ELLIPSE``, ``RECT``, ``ARC``, ``TRIANGLE``, ``SPHERE``, ``BOX``, ``QUAD``, or ``LINE``. The parameters for each of these different shapes are the same as their corresponding functions: ``ellipse()``, ``rect()``, ``arc()``, ``triangle()``, ``sphere()``, ``box()``, ``quad()``, and ``line()``. The first example above clarifies how this works.

Custom, unique shapes can be made by using ``create_shape()`` without a parameter. After the shape is started, the drawing attributes and geometry can be set directly to the shape within the ``begin_shape()`` and ``end_shape()`` methods. See the second example above for specifics, and the reference for ``begin_shape()`` for all of its options.

The  ``create_shape()`` function can also be used to make a complex shape made of other shapes. This is called a "group" and it's created by using the parameter ``GROUP`` as the first parameter. See the fourth example above to see how it works.

After using ``create_shape()``, stroke and fill color can be set by calling methods like ``set_fill()`` and ``set_stroke()``, as seen in the examples above. The complete list of methods and fields for the PShape class are in the Processing Javadoc.
