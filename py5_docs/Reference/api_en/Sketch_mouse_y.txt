@@ description
The system variable `mouse_y` always contains the current vertical coordinate of the mouse.

Note that py5 can only track the mouse position when the pointer is over the current window. The default value of `mouse_y` is `0`, so `0` will be returned until the mouse moves in front of the Sketch window. (This typically happens when a Sketch is first run.)  Once the mouse moves away from the window, `mouse_y` will continue to report its most recent position.

@@ example
def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.line(20, py5.mouse_y, 80, py5.mouse_y)
