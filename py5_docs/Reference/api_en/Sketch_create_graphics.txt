@@ description
Creates and returns a new ``Py5Graphics`` object. Use this class if you need to draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. The first two parameters define the width and height in pixels. The third, optional parameter specifies the renderer. It can be defined as ``P2D``, ``P3D``, ``PDF``, or SVG. If the third parameter isn't used, the default renderer is set. The ``PDF`` and ``SVG`` renderers require the filename parameter.

It's important to consider the renderer used with ``create_graphics()`` in relation to the main renderer specified in :doc:`size`. For example, it's only possible to use ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` with ``create_graphics()`` when one of them is defined in :doc:`size`. ``P2D`` and ``P3D`` use OpenGL for drawing, and when using an OpenGL renderer it's necessary for the main drawing surface to be OpenGL-based. If ``P2D`` or ``P3D`` are used as the renderer in :doc:`size`, then any of the options can be used with ``create_graphics()``. If the default renderer is used in :doc:`size`, then only the default, ``PDF``, or ``SVG`` can be used with ``create_graphics()``.

It's important to run all drawing functions between the :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw`. As the exception to this rule, :doc:`smooth` should be run on the Py5Graphics object before :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw`. See the reference for :doc:`smooth` for more detail. 

The ``create_graphics()`` function should almost never be used inside ``draw()`` because of the memory and time needed to set up the graphics. One-time or occasional use during ``draw()`` might be acceptable, but code that calls ``create_graphics()`` at 60 frames per second might run out of memory or freeze your Sketch.

Unlike the main drawing surface which is completely opaque, surfaces created with ``create_graphics()`` can have transparency. This makes it possible to draw into a graphics and maintain the alpha channel. By using :doc:`save` to write a ``PNG`` or ``TGA`` file, the transparency of the graphics object will be honored.
