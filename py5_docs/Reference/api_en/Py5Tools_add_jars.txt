add_jars(path: Union[Path, str]) -> None

path: Union[Path, str] - path to directory containing jar files

@@ description
Add all of the Java jar files contained in a directory and its subdirectories to the classpath. The path can be absolute or relative. If the directory does does not exist, it will be ignored.

When ``import py5`` is executed, ``add_jars('jars')`` is called for you to automatically add jar files contained in a subdirectory called jars. This is similar to functionality provided by the Processing IDE.

After the JVM has started, the classpath cannot be changed. This function will throw a ``RuntimeError`` if it is called after the JVM has already started. Use :doc:`is_jvm_running` to first determine if the JVM is running.

@@ example
import py5_tools

py5_tools.add_jars('path/to/project_jars')
py5_tools.add_classpath('path/to/jar/file/java_code.jar')

import py5

print(py5_tools.get_classpath())
