@@ description
Helper function to render a sequence of frames using the passed ``draw`` function argument. The output is returned as a list of ``PIL.Image`` objects. Use the ``limit`` keyword argument to specify the number of frames to return.

The passed function's first parameter must be a ``py5.Sketch`` object, and that object must be used for all of the function's py5 commands. The function can have additional positional and keyword arguments. To use them, pass the desired values to ``render_frame_sequence``'s ``draw_args`` and ``draw_kwargs`` arguments.

Optionally, the caller can pass a ``setup`` function, along with corresponding ``setup_args`` and ``setup_kwargs`` arguments. This will be called once, just like it would for any other py5 sketch. As with the passed ``draw`` function, the first parameter must be a ``py5.Sketch`` object.

Currently, only the default and OpenGL renderers are supported.

This function facilitates the creation and execution of a py5 Sketch, and as a result makes it easy to run a Sketch inside of another Sketch. This is discouraged, and may fail catastrophically.

This function is available in decorator form as :doc:`render_sequence`.
