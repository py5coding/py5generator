get_current_sketch() -> Sketch

@@ description
Get the py5 module's current ``Sketch`` instance.

When coding py5 in module mode, a Sketch instance is created on your behalf that is referenced within the py5 module itself. That Sketch is called the "current sketch." Use this method to access that Sketch instance directly.

@@ example
sketch = py5.get_current_sketch()
assert sketch.is_ready
py5.run_sketch()
assert sketch.is_running
py5.exit_sketch()
assert sketch.is_dead
