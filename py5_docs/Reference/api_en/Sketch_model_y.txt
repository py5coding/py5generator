@@ description
Returns the three-dimensional X, Y, Z position in model space. This returns the Y value for a given coordinate based on the current set of transformations (scale, rotate, translate, etc.) The Y value can be used to place an object in space relative to the location of the original point once the transformations are no longer in use. 

In the example, the ``model_x()``, ``model_y()``, and ``model_z()`` functions record the location of a box in space after being placed using a series of translate and rotate commands. After ``pop_matrix()`` is called, those transformations no longer apply, but the (x, y, z) coordinate returned by the model functions is used to place another box in the same location.
