@@ variables
hook_post_draw: bool = False - attach hook to Sketch's post_draw method instead of draw
sketch: Sketch = None - running Sketch

@@ description
Take a screenshot of a running Sketch.

The returned image is a `PIL.Image` object. It can be assigned to a variable or embedded in the notebook.

By default the Sketch will be the currently running Sketch, as returned by [](py5functions_get_current_sketch). Use the `sketch` parameter to specify a different running Sketch, such as a Sketch created using Class mode.

If your Sketch has a `post_draw()` method, use the `hook_post_draw` parameter to make this function run after `post_draw()` instead of `draw()`. This is important when using Processing libraries that support `post_draw()` such as Camera3D or ColorBlindness.

@@ example
import time
import py5_tools

py5.run_sketch()
# take a screenshot of the running sketch after a two second delay
time.sleep(2)
img = py5_tools.screenshot()
img.save('image.png')
