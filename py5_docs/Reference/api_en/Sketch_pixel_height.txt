@@ description
When ``pixel_density(2)`` is used to make use of a high resolution display (called a Retina display on OS X or high-dpi on Windows and Linux), the width and height of the sketch do not change, but the number of pixels is doubled. As a result, all operations that use pixels (like ``load_pixels()``, ``get()``, ``set()``, etc.) happen in this doubled space. As a convenience, the variables ``pixel_width`` and ``pixel_height`` hold the actual width and height of the sketch in pixels. This is useful for any sketch that uses the ``pixels[]`` array, for instance, because the number of elements in the array will be ``pixel_width*pixel_height``, not ``width*height``.
