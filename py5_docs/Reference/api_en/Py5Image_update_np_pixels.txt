update_np_pixels() -> None

@@ description
Updates the image with the data in the :doc:`py5image_np_pixels` array. Use in conjunction with :doc:`py5image_load_np_pixels`. If you're only reading pixels from the array, there's no need to call ``update_np_pixels()`` — updating is only necessary to apply changes.

The ``update_np_pixels()`` method is similar to :doc:`py5image_update_pixels` in that ``update_np_pixels()`` must be called after modifying :doc:`py5image_np_pixels` just as :doc:`py5image_update_pixels` must be called after modifying :doc:`py5image_pixels`.

@@ example
image = Py5Image_update_np_pixels_0.png

def setup():
    my_image = py5.load_image("apples.jpg")
    my_image.load_np_pixels()
    my_image.np_pixels[:50, :, :] = my_image.np_pixels[50:100, :, :]
    my_image.update_np_pixels()
    py5.image(my_image, 0, 0)
