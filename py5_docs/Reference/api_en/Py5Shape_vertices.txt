coordinates: npt.NDArray[np.floating] - 2D array of vertex coordinates and optional UV texture mapping values

@@ description
Create a collection of vertices. The purpose of this method is to provide an alternative to repeatedly calling [](py5shape_vertex) in a loop. For a large number of vertices, the performance of `vertices()` will be much faster.

The `coordinates` parameter should be a numpy array with one row for each vertex. There should be two or three columns for 2D or 3D points, respectively. There may also be an additional two columns for UV texture mapping values.

@@ example
image = Py5Shape_vertices_0.png

import numpy as np

def setup():
    random_triangle_vertices = 100 * np.random.rand(25, 2)
    s = py5.create_shape()
    with s.begin_shape(s.TRIANGLES):
        s.vertices(random_triangle_vertices)
    py5.shape(s)
