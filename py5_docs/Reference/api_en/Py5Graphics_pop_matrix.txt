pop_matrix() -> None

@@ description
Pops the current transformation matrix off the matrix stack. Understanding pushing and popping requires understanding the concept of a matrix stack. The :doc:`py5graphics_push_matrix` function saves the current coordinate system to the stack and ``pop_matrix()`` restores the prior coordinate system. :doc:`py5graphics_push_matrix` and ``pop_matrix()`` are used in conjuction with the other transformation functions and may be embedded to control the scope of the transformations.

This method is the same as :doc:`pop_matrix` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`pop_matrix`.
