@@ description
Load an image into a variable of type ``Py5Image``. Four types of images (GIF, JPG, TGA, PNG) can be loaded. To load images in other formats, consider using :doc:`convert_image`.

The ``image_path`` parameter can be a file or a URL. When loading a file, the path can be in the data directory, relative to the current working directory (:doc:`sketch_path`), or an absolute path. When loading from a URL, the ``image_path`` parameter must start with ``http://`` or ``https://``. If the image cannot be loaded, a Python ``RuntimeError`` will be thrown.

In most cases, load all images in ``setup()`` to preload them at the start of the program. Loading images inside ``draw()`` will reduce the speed of a program. In those situations, consider using :doc:`request_image` instead.

The ``dst`` parameter allows users to store the loaded image into an existing Py5Image object instead of creating a new object. The size of the existing Py5Image object must match the size of the loaded image. Most users will not find the ``dst`` parameter helpful. This feature is needed internally for performance reasons.

@@ example
image = Sketch_load_image_0.png

def setup():
    py5.background(0)
    img = py5.load_image('apples.jpg')
    py5.image(img, 10, 10)
