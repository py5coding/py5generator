@@ description
To create vectors from 3D data, use the ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw` commands. These commands will grab the shape data just before it is rendered to the screen. At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of individual lines and triangles. This means that a shape created with ``sphere()`` function will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a single object. Or that a multi-segment line shape (such as a curve) will be rendered as individual segments.

When using ``begin_raw()`` and :doc:`end_raw`, it's possible to write to either a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, ``begin_raw()`` with the PDF library will write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines, even if recording from the ``P3D`` renderer. 

If you want a background to show up in your files, use ``rect(0, 0, width, height)`` after setting the ``fill()`` to the background color. Otherwise the background will not be rendered to the file because the background is not shape.

Using ``hint(ENABLE_DEPTH_SORT)`` can improve the appearance of 3D geometry drawn to 2D file formats.

See examples in the reference for the ``PDF`` and ``DXF`` libraries for more information.
