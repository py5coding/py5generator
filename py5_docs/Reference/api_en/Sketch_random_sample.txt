random_sample(objects: list[Any], size: int = 1, replace: bool = True) -> list[Any]

@@ variables
objects: list[Any] - list of objects to choose from
replace: bool = True - whether to select random items with or without replacement
size: int = 1 - number of random items to select

@@ description
Select random items from a list. The list items can be of any type. If multiple items are selected, this function will by default allow the same item to be selected multiple times. Set the `replace` parameter to `False` to prevent the same item from being selected multiple times.

The returned value will always be a sequence such as a list or numpy array, even if only one item is sampled. If you only want to sample one item, consider using [](sketch_random_choice) instead. If the list of objects is empty, an empty list will be returned.

This function's randomness can be influenced by [](sketch_random_seed), and makes calls to numpy to select the random items.

@@ example
def setup():
    words = ["apple", "bear", "cat", "dog"]
    word = py5.random_sample(words)
    py5.println(word)  # Prints one of the four words
