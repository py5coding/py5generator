@@ description
Copies a region of pixels from the `Py5Graphics` object to another area of the canvas and copies a region of pixels from an image used as the `src_img` parameter into the `Py5Graphics` object. If the source and destination regions aren't the same size, it will automatically resize the source pixels to fit the specified target region. No alpha information is used in the process, however if the source image has an alpha channel set, it will be copied as well.

This function ignores [](py5graphics_image_mode).

This method is the same as [](sketch_copy) but linked to a `Py5Graphics` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see [](sketch_copy).
