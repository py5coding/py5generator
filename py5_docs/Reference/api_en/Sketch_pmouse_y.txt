@@ description
The system variable ``pmouse_y`` always contains the vertical position of the mouse in the frame previous to the current frame.

For more detail on how ``pmouse_y`` is updated inside of mouse events and ``draw()``, see the reference for ``pmouse_x``.

@@ example
# move the mouse quickly to see the difference
# between the current and previous position
def draw():
    py5.background(204)
    py5.line(20, py5.mouse_y, 80, py5.pmouse_y)
    print(py5.mouse_y + " : " + py5.pmouse_y)
